# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated.

## Guidelines

1. **Code Standards:** Please ensure your code is clean, efficient and adheres to standard coding practices. We primarily use JavaScript, so familiarize yourself with its standards and best practices.

2. **Documentation:** Comment your code where necessary. This helps other contributors understand the purpose of your code, especially for complex logic.

3. **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages describing the changes you've made.

4. **Respect Existing Code:** If you are making changes to existing code, please respect the original author's style and logic. Major changes should be discussed with the maintainers before implementation.

5. **Testing:** Please test your code before submitting a pull request. This helps maintain the quality and reliability of the codebase.

## Steps for Contributing

2. **Branch:** Create a new branch for each issue or feature you're working on. This helps isolate your changes and makes it easier for others to understand your contribution.

3. **Commit & Push:** Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

4. **Pull Request:** Submit a pull request from your forked repository to our main repository. In the pull request description, explain the changes you made, why you made them, and which issue(s) you're addressing.

5. **Review & Merge:** Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main codebase.
