Prompt engineering refers to the practice of designing and structuring the input (prompt) to an AI model in a way that maximizes the likelihood of receiving the desired output.

### Principles

- Ensure prompts are precise and unambiguous.
- Allow sufficient time for the model to process.

### Delimiters

- Delimiters, such as "\n---\n","```", can demarcate different sections of input.
- GPT models do not inherently attach any meaning to delimiters. Their significance is learned from usage patterns in training data.

### Hallucinations

- Hallucinations refer to outputs from AI models that are not rooted in their training data or the given input.
- Clarity and specificity in prompts can mitigate hallucinations.
- Caution should be used when asking the model to cite sources, as this could trigger hallucinations.

### Few-Shot Prompting

- Few-shot prompting involves giving task examples before providing the actual prompt.
- The utility of few-shot prompting varies based on task complexity and the relevancy of the examples.

### Determination

- Determination means sticking to a specific topic or style in the model's response.
- Topic drift in longer responses can be mitigated by reinforcing the main topic.

### Structured Prompts

- Structured prompts guide model's output by explicitly organizing the input.
- They're especially useful for tasks requiring a specific output format or style.

### Iterative Prompt development

- Start with clear, specific prompts.
- Understand the root cause if outputs are not as expected.
- Refine the prompt based on your understanding.
- Repeat the process until desired results are achieved.

### Iterative process

- Start with a trial approach.
- Analyze the shortcomings if outputs do not meet expectations.
- Clarify instructions and allocate more time for processing.
- Refine prompts using a collection of examples.

### Summarizing

- Summarizing reduces lengthy content to core points, allowing efficient understanding.

### Inferring

- Inferring involves extracting valuable information such as:
  - Relevant details
  - Emotions
  - Intent
  - Sentiment
  - Classifications

### Transforming

- Transforming involves modifying content, which can include:
  - Format conversions
  - Paraphrasing
  - Style transfers
  - Grammar and spelling corrections
  - Translations

### Expanding

- Expanding involves adding information to a piece of text, such as:
  - Generating a list of items
  - Adding more detail to a text

### Custom Chatbot

- Chatbots enhance customer interaction through personalized experiences and can assist with:
  - Answering queries
  - Offering recommendations
  - Gathering feedback
