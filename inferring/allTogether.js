    Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one had
    additional storage and not too high of a price point.
    Got it fast.  The string to our lamp broke during the
    transit and the company happily sent over a new one.
    Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put
    together.  I had a missing part, so I contacted their
    support and they very quickly got me the missing piece!
    Lumina seems to me to be a great company that cares
    about their customers and products!!
